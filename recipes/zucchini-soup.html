<p>
    <h1>Ingredients</h1>
</p>

<ul>
    <li>2 tbs Olive Oil</li>
    <li>1 lrg Onion, chopped</li>
    <li>2 cloves Garlic, minced</li>
    <li>4 med Zucchini, chopped</li>
    <li>1 ltr (4 cups) vegetable stock</li>
    <li>1 tsp dried Thyme (or fresh)</li>
    <li>Salt and Pepper to taste</li>
    <li>Fresh parsley or basil for Garnish (optional)</li>
    <li>100ml (1/2 cup) cream (optional)</li>
    <li>Grated Parmesan (optional, for serving)</li>
</ul>
<p><h1>Method</h1></p>
<ol>
    <li><h2>Saute the Onions and Garlic</h2></li>
    <p>
        Heat the Oil in a large pot over medium heat. Add the chopped onion and saute for 5-7 min until softened and translucent. 
    <p>Stir in the minced garlic and cook for an additional 1-2 min, until fragrant</p>
    </p>
    <li><h2>Add the Zucchini</h2></li>
    <p>Add the chopped Zucchini to the pot, stirring well.
        <p>Cook for approx. 5 min, allowing the Zucchini to soften.</p>
    </p>
    <li><h2>Add Stock and Thyme</h2></li>
    <p>Pour in the Vegetable Stock, making sure the Zucchini is fully submerged.
        <p>Add the Thyme and season with the Salt and Pepper to taste.</p>
        <p>Bring the mixture to a boil, then reduce heat to low and simmer for 10-15 min, or until Zucchini is tender.</p>
    </p>
    <li><h2>Blend the Soup</h2></li>
    <p>Remove the Pot from the heat and use an immersion blender to puree until smooth.
        <p>Less if you prefer a chunkier soup.</p>
        <p>Alternatively, transfer to a blender and blitz in batches.</p>
    </p>
    <li><h2>Add cream (optional) and Adjust Seasoning</h2></li>
    <p>For a richer, creamier soup reheat gently and stir in cream. Taste and adjust seasoning if needed.</p>
    <li><h2>Serve</h2></li>
    <p>Ladle generously into bowls.</p>
    <p>Garnish with chopped Parsley or Basil and (optional) grate Parmesan over your delicous healthy Zucchini Soup.</p>
